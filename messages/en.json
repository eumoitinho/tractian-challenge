      {
        "question": "How can I reduce unplanned downtime at my plant?",
        "answer": "Tractian uses AI-powered sensors that continuously monitor your machines' vibration, temperature, and other parameters. When anomalies are detected, you get early alerts — so you can plan repairs before a breakdown happens."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I prove ROI using Tractian?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Tractian tracks downtime avoided, maintenance costs, work order completion rates, and more. You can export detailed reports to leadership showing exactly how much time and money you're saving."
      },
      {
        "question": "How hard is it to install and start using Tractian?",
        "answer": "Installation is quick and non-invasive. Our team handles the sensor setup and software configuration, and most plants are up and running within days — not months."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Tractian really help if my team is understaffed?",
        "answer": "Yes. Tractian automates work order creation, prioritizes tasks by criticality, and reduces manual inspections. Your team focuses on what matters most instead of fighting fires."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to replace my current systems to use Tractian?",
        "answer": "No. Tractian integrates with your existing tools — including SAP, Oracle, and other CMMS platforms. We work alongside your current setup, not against it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Tractian support compliance and audit preparation?",
        "answer": "Every maintenance action, sensor reading, and work order is automatically logged. You get a full audit trail with timestamps and accountability, making compliance reviews straightforward."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of reporting does Tractian offer?",
        "answer": "From high-level executive dashboards to granular asset-level analytics. Filter by site, area, asset type, failure mode, or timeframe — and export data for reviews, budgets, and board presentations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Tractian easy for technicians to use?",
        "answer": "Very. The mobile app is intuitive and built for the shop floor. Technicians can view tasks, log work, and access SOPs in just a few taps — no extensive training needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of support is included with Tractian?",
        "answer": "White-glove support from day one. You get a dedicated team for installation, training, and ongoing optimization. We're on site when it matters and always available remotely."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Tractian across multiple sites?",
        "answer": "Yes. Tractian's multi-site architecture lets you monitor and manage all your facilities from a single dashboard, with standardized processes across every location."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of machines or equipment does Tractian work with?",
        "answer": "Tractian works with virtually any rotating or critical equipment — motors, pumps, compressors, fans, conveyors, and more. If it moves or vibrates, we can monitor it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Tractian require Wi-Fi or internal networks?",
        "answer": "Tractian sensors use their own connectivity (cellular/LoRa), so you don't need to depend on your plant's Wi-Fi or IT infrastructure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Tractian help with standardizing processes across teams?",
        "answer": "Yes. With built-in SOPs, templates, and automated workflows, you can ensure every team follows the same procedures regardless of site or shift."

      },
      {
        "question": "Does Tractian integrate with my existing tools?",
        "answer": "Yes. Tractian integrates with SAP, Oracle NetSuite, Power BI, and many other enterprise platforms via APIs and native connectors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Tractian secure?",
