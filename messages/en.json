      {
        "question": "How can I reduce unplanned downtime at my plant?",
        "answer": "Tractian condition monitoring detects early-stage failures and sends alerts before breakdowns happen — giving you time to act. Combined with our CMMS, those alerts automatically generate work orders, assign tasks, and track progress, so nothing slips through the cracks. You prevent failures and stay organized while doing it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I prove ROI using Tractian?",
        "answer": "Yes, easily. Tractian gives you the data to prove clear ROI through reduced unplanned downtime, lower maintenance costs (by avoiding expensive emergency repairs), and extended asset lifespan. Our insights help you quantify the financial impact and optimize operational efficiency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How hard is it to install and start using Tractian?",
        "answer": "It's plug-and-play. Vibration sensors are installed in minutes, and our platform is intuitive — no complex onboarding or training required. Most teams are up and running within a day."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Tractian really help if my team is understaffed?",
        "answer": "Yes. Our condition monitoring pinpoints the issues, while the CMMS turns them into clear, actionable tasks. Together, they eliminate time spent digging through data, guessing priorities, or chasing paperwork. You get straight-to-the-point alerts, smart scheduling, and full visibility so your team can act fast — even with fewer hands."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to replace my current systems to use Tractian?",
        "answer": "No. Tractian is designed to work alongside your existing tools, including ERPs, maintenance systems, and spreadsheets. You can start where you are and scale without disruption."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Tractian support compliance and audit preparation?",
        "answer": "Tractian builds compliance into everyday maintenance. It tracks safety validations, work permits, SOPs, and historical logs in one place — so you can instantly export reports and prove due diligence during audits or inspections."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of reporting does Tractian offer?",
        "answer": "Tractian offers leadership-ready insights, including maintenance costs, backlog, execution rates, asset health, and labor productivity. Reports can be customized by area, timeframe, or asset type — and exported for planning or presentations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Tractian easy for technicians to use?",
        "answer": "Yes. Tractian is mobile-first and built for the field. Tasks, checklists, and diagnostics are available in just a few taps — helping your team execute work orders, validate fixes, and stay productive without extra admin."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Tractian across multiple sites?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What types of machines or equipment does Tractian work with?",
        "answer": "Tractian is designed to support a wide range of critical equipment — from motors and pumps to compressors and other industrial assets — whether they're modern or aging."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Tractian require Wi-Fi or internal networks?",
        "answer": "Tractian sensors use independent connectivity, so there's no need for internal network access or complex IT setup. Your data syncs automatically to our secure cloud platform. You can access the software from any desktop with internet access, or use the mobile app — even offline — right from the plant floor."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Tractian help with standardizing processes across teams?",
        "answer": "Yes. Tractian ensures repeatability through digital SOPs, safety tracking, and centralized documentation. It's easy to see what was done, when, and by whom — across all shifts and teams."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I migrate my existing maintenance data?",
        "answer": "Yes. We provide easy data migration tools and hands-on support to bring in your historical records from Excel, ERP, CMMS, or other systems. You won't lose your legacy data."
      },
